# db1234 is the commit I want to split into two or more commits

git rebase -i db1234^

# replace the "pick" before db1234 to "e", which means "edit" commit
# when back to terminal

git reset HEAD~

# this will unstaged to changes in the commit, then

git add -p filename

# or whatever, if files are separated, you can just commit them one by one
# the idea here is that, rebase then reset, quite good!
