# you do some changes, but not want to commit
# or you want to rebase which complains about uncommit changes
# you can use stash to temporarily place the changes

git stash    # stash changes, now repo is clean

git list    # check out all stashes

git apply    # apply the latest stash, i.e., the recent changes

git apply stash@{3}    # apply stash@{3} in the stash list
